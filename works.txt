 A locale ID reflects the local conventions and language for a particular
 geographical region. A given language might be spoken in more than one
 Country/Region; for example, portuguese is spoken in Brazil as well as in
 Portugal. Conversely, a countryregion might have more than one official 
 language.  for example, Canada has two language English and French. 
 Thus Canada has two distinct locales: Canadian-English and Canadian-
 French. Some locale -dependent categories include the formatting of dates
 and the display format for monetary value.
 The language determins the text and data formatting conventions,
 while the contry/regiondetermins the national vonventions.Every language
 has unique mapping represented by code page, which include characters oth
 er than those in the alphabet ( ushc as punctuationmarks and number)

 the locale refers to the locality :
   country
   region
   language

   for which you can customize certain aspects of your program.
   Some locale-dependent categories include the formmatting of dates
   and the display format for monetary values. for more information,
   see locale categories

   Use the setlocale function to change ro query  some or all of the 
   currnet program or thread locale information while using functions 
   without the _l suffix. .The  function with the_l suffix will use 
   the locale parameter padded in for their locale information during
   the execution of that specific function only.

   This article is about readingand writing Unicode to character streams
   in UTF-8 encoding.
   And as a consequence is about an often mis-known aspect fo the C++ STL
   /Iostream library locales.

   The doc that comewith the STL itself, although thecnically perfect does
   not help so much in understanding the relation between the object that
   are involved a evensimple expression like a_stream >> variable;
   also because some of the detail are hidden by underlying logic.

Also, the behavior of the STL asn the relation with the operating system
are not always so evidents, letting certain operations some"mysterious"
This article goes into some aspect of the UNICODE Encoding, STL locales,
and the relation with Windows. The code we are referring is though as 
serving VC8, as well as MINGW.

The history of chracters encoding is NOT the most linear as it could be.
a number of assumption made at certain time that has been reverted later
made and still make some confusions.

In the beginning
In the beginning there where the ty. pewriters and the teltypes that 
- in essence = where typewriters with wires between the kyboad and the pa
per. In the need to grand interoperability between the two halves of 
these machines, the ANSI committee defined the ASCII character set.
This set was designed to provide a binary representation for the 26 Latin 
characters, either insmall and capital format.
Some punctuation and accents, and to some "commands" of typical use in 
teletyping like CR, LF, FF, etc.. adn was designed to staty ito 7 bit,
to help he hardware manufactureer in having the 8th bit available for e
rror checking parity. The missing of accented character was not a big deal,
since teletyping is over-impressive an "a" was simply written as a BS'
Different countries where alos not necessary neededto be supported: ASCII
is the American Standard Code.." Who'S not American, just used another en
coding schema. INteractive computers complicated a while this aspects.

 + Ther circulation of software was anymore a country limited affair and..
 + The nature of a display required a character matrix associating a code
   prepesenting thedisplayed "character" at a given positon, hence...
 + Tricks like the use of backspace to get composed characaters where no
   more effective.
 
 A number of attempt to extend the ASCII character set where done first
 by hardware manufacturer. IBM - when introducing the first PC comewith 
 an 8 bit char-set having 256 symbols matching the ASCII ones form  32
 to 126 and adding some accented letters, some mathematical symbols,
 some semi-graphics.  all of those some-s where a result of compromise 
 that -in fact - didn't matcheveryone's  needs. it jus tattempt to satisfy
 90 parsent of the user o 90 persent of the IBM served countries at the 
 time. but it fitted 8 bits.

 The incomming of Code-pages...........
 To Better solve the problem, the concept of Code-page was introduced.
 Essentially the correspondence between code andglyphswas made configurable

 again 

 The Correspondence between CODE and Glyphs WAS MADE CONFIGURABLE.

 So that every countruy  could configure the 2nd half of the char-set with
 the characters that it more needed. interoperability was assured only the
 first 128 codes.


 Later DOS versions and earlier Windows, used the 8 bit ANSI code, with a
 number of codepage for a variety of "editions".

 The drawback of this method was that was essentially impossible to hold
 text MIXING different Very heterogeneous language mixing up Arabic and 
 Japanese was practically impossible.
 and reading a French text with an arabic PC was sometimes a pleasure,and
 evern French to Italian leaded to strage mis-writings due to the fact that
 some accedn characters had different coding
 also , a problem was still present with languagesthat require more that
 18 specific symbols ( think to Chinese); for them multi-byte code-pages 
 has beenintroduced giving MBCS.

 UNICODE:
 Unicode was introduced mainly to try to cleanup all of this mess:
 assuming that the world cannot fit into 8 bits, 
 it gave a sidtinct ID to every encoded symbole. This is known as UCS

 Universal Character Set. 
 In its first definition it was containing less than 65536 characters,
 ( 2byte ) and thismade many software developer confident that 16bits where
 enough to represent them all. This is known as UCS-2.
 The acutal sisutation sees an UCS defineup to 0x10FFFF (although with many
 still unassignedelements),thus requireing 21bits.

 UCS-4 (4 bytes ) using unsigned int ( often typedef-ined as dchar_t ) as
 characgters certainly fits everything,but for many languages it is a
 wasting of space. also, may commucication channel drive bytes, not short
 or int, and the way bytes are orderd into shorts adn ints depends onthe
 architecutres of processorsandmachines, hence a pur binary dump ofdchars
 or wchars is nOT practicable for files that  are designed to communication
 or interoperation betwendifferent machines or devices.

 Popular Unicodeencodings.
 To track the above problems,a number of encodign, attempting to keep safe
 the interoperability with legacy environments have been deployed for 7,
 8, 16 and 32bit environments.
 In particular, with the windows environments, where Unicode was originally
 deployed as UCS-2 (16bits) and communications are stilll working on byts,
 the 8 bits and 16 bits are particularly useful and comfortable.

 These encodings are known as UTF-8 and UTF-16

 The first is important in files, where  an interchangeability with non
 windows environments is required. since it does not depend on machine
 endiannes. 
 The second is important since it replaced USC-2 inside the WIn32 APIs
 thus granting support also for character not fitting the first 65536 
 codes by usign a multi-word scheme. ( note taht UCS-2 and UTF-16 are not 
 the same: They coincide only for the first 65536-2048 codep-points)

 Windows and Unicode:
 The Windows operating system evolved from original IBM character set 
 ( or better, OEM char-set, since different manufacturer may have different
 iated ) towards the ANSI char-set and codepages.


 This refers to 8 bit characters and language-dependent encodings and  was
 used mainly in Win16. with the incomming of Win32, Unicode was adopted
 first as pure UCS-2, and then extended to support UTF-16 surrogates.

 The API binaries that manipulate character where doubled and renamed by a
 dding an "A" for ANSI and W for Wide. the first taking chars based parame
 ers adn the secoundtaking wchar_t based paramters.
 A number of preprocessor "magics" are thendefined in<tchar.h> where, depen
 ding on te UNICODE and MBCS preprocessor symbols the  traditional apiname
  are mapped in to the corresponding A or W

WINDOWS and LOCALIZATIOn
To take care of the difference various countries and cultures may have in
representing numbers, dates, currency etc. Windows introduced the concept
of LOCALE as a set of informations that can be retrieved by APIs and
that can be user customizable, to help programs to adapt to user habitudes.



All thouse information are stored in the system registory.
THe os provides a set of default value for thevarious countries, but 
users canoverride them by providing their own specifications.

Indise Windwos UTF8 to 16 and 16 to 8 conversions are possible through
the WideCharToMultiByte() and MultiByteTOWideChar functions,by specifying
CP_UTF8 as the codepage parameter.
IT SI ANYWAY A STRING=TO=STRING CONVERSION, not an encoding/decode of a
stream!!!!!


C and Unicode
C language completely pre-detes either Unicode and Windows,and in fact does
not provide any direct support for Unicode, but a number of library 
function had been adapted to take care of internationalization.

IN this environment, a number of character oriented functions like atof
gained their corespondent _wtof and -with the same preprocessor magic of
 <tchar.h> a _ttof is defined as one or the other depending on the defini
 tionof a UNICODE or MBCS symbol. 
 What char and wchar_t effectively represent depends on the code-page used
 that in turn with a locale defines theway numbers and represented and
 how characters are encoded. Unfortunately, the way C library is implementd
 defines localecharacteristics based on a set of static data, selectable 
 with a set_locale function.
 Such data has nothing to deal with the ones provided by the OS concept of
 LOCALE and are not "user customizable" ( think to the caseof thousand 
 separator, replaced by an+. there is however the possibility to convert
 an UTF-8 stringinto UTF-16 with thembcstows function, specifying a locale
 having a UTF-8 codepage.

 C++and UNicode
 C++ approach to i/o is based on the stream concept. Howstreamsrelates to
 files it is not so obvious since the stl documentation, does not provide
 a plain description on that. YOU have to read about a number of details
 of a variety of classes before having a clue about what architecture is 
 behind.

 So, let's go in the detail as much is sufficient  to understand where is 
  the clue.

  Streams buffers and locales

  This classes have a collaborative role in playing input and output.

  * Streamsare responsible to provide the interface for insertion and
   extraction operators and formatting manipulators.
  * Buffers andresponsibleto provide the transit storage for the elements
    that are read and writtenfrom the external source and to manage such 
	reading and writing.
  * Locale provides the functionality to handle "REPRESNTATION" and "CONVE
    RSION". they do so by a number of "facets" that deals with the
	vonversionof nmbers into character strings( withthenumget and numput
	facets) and of thetranslation of characters from the prgram representa
	tion form and to the external representation (with the codecvt facet)

 All that is a set of family of classes that manage different character 
 prepresentaions ( char ro wchar_t ) and differnt nature of external 
 streams (file or string).

 All streams must hold a buffer derived form basestreambuf<.> and 
 locale, initialized by default as the C++ global locale (
 initialized in turn as the classic "C" locale).

 In particular file streams are noting more than basic streams 
 initialized with a basic_filebuf<.>, that override the 
 basic_streambuf<.> virsutal function to manage file i/o, plus some
 pass-through function like open, close etc.
 Similarly, string streams are basic streams initialized with basicstringbuf
  
  The template parameters defines the type of elements used by the stream
  internally to the program. in windows environments they are normally 
  char for ANSI oriented character representation and to wcharT for 
  Unicode ( UTF-16) orientedrepresentation.

  But something strange happens with file stream try its.
 I 
  That's ansi, with the text that appear truncated by the Euro symbol
  and fs.good() is false

 This means that a Unicodes string will be converted to an ANSI string
 (before it is writtento theinternal buffer. To store Unicode string
 in buffer, create new buffer of type wchar_t and set it useng the basic
 _streambuf::pubsetfub()method. To see an example that demonstrates thsi
 behavio, seebelow.

 In essence, it seems nobody wans to say clearly that outputs going to 
 file ( yes, old C file, tha's what basic_filebuf writes to and read from
 there no magic behind that ) by default is always attempted to be 
  converted into chars using the actual global locale facets.

  In VC8 this happens with std::codevct<wchat_t,char,mbstate_t> facet that's
   part of the default global locale,operatingonaninternal char buffer,
   In mingw no such facet is declared, and hence the locale cannot provide 
   it. (hence the exception)

   and that'S the key to go towards UTF8 let's provide to the basic_filebuf
   the facet it wants. Not another facet, with proper type and id,
   ( locales can support whatever number of "facets") since that's not what the buffer class is seeking for. We have to derive the proper std::
   codecvt<wchar_t,char,mbstat_t> and where no such type is definde we have
    to defineit.


	That'S unicode represented by UTF16 in LE form. now look the output 
	ifle content with and hex editor you should get that .
	THat's ansi, with the text that appear truncated by the Euro Symbol

 We often speak inaccurately of character set:
  We may refer to a "Greek Character Set" or 
                    "Latin Character Set".

 BUT, in order to understand how differenct writing systems are
 supported by Windows,We need to be more precis about character

 User don't view or print character: A user views or prints GLYPHS.
 A glyph is a representation ofa character. The character "Capital Letter
 A" is represented by theglyph "A"intimesNew Roman Bold and "A" in Arai 
 Bold. A font is a collection of glyphs.


  Font --------* Glyphs


  Windows is able to retrieve the appropriate glyphs by using mapping 
  information about the keyboard, the language system inuse, a the 
  glyphs associated with each character.


  Font ---------* Glyphs 1 ------------- 1 Character


  Fonts are designed with character sets in mind: A font for use 
  in Russia will include glyphs representing Cyrillic Characters.
  There is no magic word or blessing uttered to create a "character set".
  A character set is only a Collection of Characters.

  FONT ----- * GLYPH 1 ======= 1 CHARACTER * ------ CHARACTERSET

  However, characters form different languages system are conventionally 
  divided into differenct "Character Sets", primarily Because,
  in the past, a limited number of Characters could be addressed "at any
  one time.


  Glyphs can also represent combinations of Characters and alternate forms
  of charactersthere is NOT a strict one - to - one correspondence 
  between glyphs and characters. For example, two characters may be
  typed in a document, BUT  represented by only  a sigle glyph 
  a ligature glyph). COnversely, Differenct versions of a character may
  appear at the beginning, middle,or ending of a word.Thus a signle Charac
  ter can be represented by Sereral different glyphs in a font.

  Characters are represented by character codes.
  Character codes are generated and stored when a user inputs a document.
  Single-Byte Charcter sets (SBCS) provede 256 character code.
  This is an adequate number to encode most of the characters needed for
  Western Europe. For example, the Windows Extended ANSI character set 
  contains 256 characters consisting of Latin Letters, Arabic Numbers
  punctuation,and drawingcharacterrs.

 What is the sizeof boolean variable.
 does it actually use only one BIT??
 If not Why not?

 You got it. Just One bit. basically you only need it to hold 2 values,
  0 for false, true for anything else.

  The minimum size for a variable is 1 byte.
  1 bit booleans could be created in a bit filed 
  sizeof() returnthe size inbyte.

  The reason why the minimum size of a variable is 1 byte
  it has to do with the way computers access memory.
  There is no way of reserving just a singlebitof memory for a variable.
  You might say memory is accessed with a resolution of eight bits.
  I believe even the  one bit boolean created using a bit field as 
  mentioned by Bazzy would require a complete byte to store.

  What is the difference between HOPE and WISH??

   + Use "HOPE" when there is hope ( a chance ) for something to happen.
   + Use "WISH" in situation, which are imagined.

   There is NO negative meaning attached to wish, and

 We have evolved such that owning up to risks is often confused with 
 defeatism.


 "shoot the messenger" : often discourages people from bringing 
 imminent problems to the attention of management.
 This attitude is the result of misunderstanding of risk.

 C/C++ editors

 Completion Proposal Fileter Completion proposal fileters may 
 have been supplied with your CDT distribution. 
 Completion proposal fileters cansort and order the proposals
 provided by the Content Assist feature to best suit your needs.
 Select the desired content assist filter from the list of available
 filters.

 Save Actions preference pnael to configure actions performed 
 by the C/C++ editor while saving a file.

 Syntax Coloring preferences
 Use the Syntax Coloringpreference panel to specify how C/C++ source
 code is rendered. Each element category (COde, Comments, and Preprocessor)
 contains a list of language elements that may be rendered with its own
 color and style. NOTE that general text editor settings such as the 
 background color can be confiured on the general Text Editors preference
 pages. Fonts may be configured on the general Colors and Fonts preference
 page.

 Code templates:
 The Code Templates preference panel lets you configure the format of 
 newly generated code stubs, comments and files.

 The code templates page contains templates that are used by actions
 that generate code and/or source files. E.g. the New Class wizard uses
 source and header file templates to create new files and code templates
 to insert generated methodstubs.

Typing preferences:
 Use the Typing preference panel to assist in formatting input as you type.

 Tutorial: Creating a simple applicaiton
  in this tutorial, you will use the CDT to create a simple 'hello world'
  application. This tutorial describes the process of creating a new C++
  project where the build is automatically managed by the CDT.
  and running the program.

  IN earlier versions of the CDT, there were two separate project types:
  Managed make (automatically generated a makefile) and Standard make

   Managed make  ( automatically generated a makefile    )
   Standard make ( required the user's makefile to build )

  To create a simple 'hello world' applicaiton using CDT,
  preform the following general steps:

   1. Creating a project.
   2. REviewing the code and building the project
   3. Running the application.


select File > new > project.
select the type of project to create.
for this tutorial, expand the c++ folder and select C++ project and
click next. The C++ project wizard opens.
By default, the CDT fileters the Toolchain and Project thes that it
displays in those lists based on the language support for the C++ Project
wizard you selected for this tutorial.

IN the project name field, type a name for the project, such as helloworld
c;; Project. This project type provides a simple hello applicaiton in C++
and the makefile is automatically created by the CDT.
Select a required toolchain from the Toolchain list.

A toolchain is a set of tools ( such as a compile, linker and assembler)
intended to build your project. Additional tools, such as a debugger,
can be associated with a toolchain. There can be several toolchains 
available, depending onthe compilers installed on your system.
Click nExt

Specify the Basic Properties for the new project, such as your author
copyright and source information then click next.

The Select Configurations page displays a list of configurations based
on the project type and toolchains selected earlier.

OPTIONAL:
if you want to change the default project settins.
Click Advanced Setting to open the Project Properties dialog for your 
new project allowing you change any of the project specific settings,
such as includes paths,, compiler options andlibraries.

Click Finish.

/*---------------*/
Note if the C++ perspective is not currently set as the defualt,
you are prompted to determined if you would like to this project
to be associated with the C/C++ perspective Click Yes.

A project is created with the default settings and a full set 
of configurations based on the project type and toolchain you selected.
you should now see the new project in Project Explorer view.

Reviewing the code and building the porjct
From the Project Explorer view, double-click the .cpp file created
fro your project, for example, helloworld.cpp You will find it within
the project "src" folder.

This file opens in a default editor.
It contains C++ template code for the Hello World example project
you selected earlier. in addition, the outline view has also been 
populated with objects created from your code.

Note  you can specify a different eidtor, and add or modify existing code
templates in Windows >  Preferences.

Optional: You can type additional code in this file, and then save the
changes by clicking  File > Save or pressing CTRL+S.
NExt you will need to build your project before you can run it.

         ===========support GNU toolchain.
		                         make
								 gcc compiler
								 gdb debugger

	Each platform that runs the CDT requires differenct steps
	to acquire this TOOLCHAIN.

	 WINDOWS:
	  MINGW/CYgwin are the thow main platform choices for acquiring the
	  GNU toolchain. It is important to understand the difference
	  between them. Cygwin produces executables that use the Cygwin
	  POSIX runtime. Note that thisruntime is GPL licensed.
	  MinGW produces procudes native Windows Executables that do not
	  require a separate runtime.

	   For MinGW,it is recommended to use the MINGW installer,
	   mingw-get, to manage your MinGW installation.
	   Download andrun thelatestmingw-get-inst package from the 
	   MinGW Downloads page. The CDT MinGW toolchain will find
	   this install if it is located in the default C:\MinGW
	   directory, the MinGW bin directory is placed in your path,
	   or if the MinGW locationis storedinthe MINGW_HOME environment
	   variable. Note that theWascaan IDE has been discontinued.

	    CDT find MINGW if it is located in the default

 Hwo to typedef a pointer to method which returns a pointer the method?

 What is a type? NO, really, what does it mean??
  One purpose of having types is to make sure that variables are always
  used in the way that they were intended to be used.
   C and C++ provide sereral built-in types that are based on t he underlying
  representation of the data. Sometimes this si good enough: when you are 
   working to save memory or perform numerical computations that require
   the right level of peecision, you want to have tight control over these
    matters.
Number are surely the most prevalent kind of data in computer programs.
They are so fundamental that people dont spend much time taking about 
them -surely everybody knows how to use nubmers in their programs.
Well, one of the wornderful things about programming is that nearly 
everywhere you look, you find more than meets the eye.

Most programmers have heard or observed one strange things or another aobutfloating point numbers For example, we often discov Ier that floating point
numbers that look the same do not necessarily stisfy C's "==" test.
New programmers are usually taught never to use == for floating point
numbers for this reason. Occasionally we
run into other exeptional cases, for instance mathematically soundformulae 
which implemented using floadtin point, produce seemingly randam or disapp
intingly inaccuarete results.


What's going on?? In truth there is much that is counterintutive about
floating point numbers, and it helps to know a thing or tow if you want to 
use them productively in your programs.

Floating point numbers provide a kind of ILLUSION. they look like "real"
numbers with decimals and possibly very large or small magnitudes.
IN reality, a 4-byte floating point nmber, for exampl, can actually howld
fewer distinct numbers is not straightforward. its represnting an integer
are interpreted literally as a binary number, 

while bits in a floating point number have a more complicated
interpretatinon.

I will talk about this interpretation at length, but first I'd like to 
discuss some conceptual differences between integers and floats.

PRECISION: seido
ACCURACY : seido


Accuracy and precision are two concepts in measurement that nicely capture 
the different properties of ints and floats  (on any system, independent o
f particular floating point representation used)

"Accuracy" refers to how close a measurement is TO THE TRUE VALUE
"precision" has to do with HOW MOCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE about a QUANTITY,
                           HOW UNIQUELY you have it pinned down.

Integer arithmetic enjoys the property of complete accuracy.
If I have the interger "2", it is exactly 2, on the dot,
and nobody can dispute that. furthermore, if I add 1 to it, I know I will
get a number that matches the correct answer bit for bit.

However intergers LACK PRECISION. DIVIDING both 5 and 4 by 2will both
yield 2. Integer are unable to keep trac ofthe fractional part, so the
informationthat i had a slightly bigger number tan 4 (namely 4)is
lost in theprocess. Integer are too "chunky" to represnt thees finer
gradations. using them is lie building with bricks. 
if you cant to make a cube, you know the brick canrepresent itperfectly,
buto a sphere wouldn't comeout quite as well( naturally, if the sphere is
significantly larger than each brick,you meightbe able to get close enough)

Floating point numbers are the aexact opposite of interger with respect to 
accuracy and precision. They have good precision, since they never deliber
athely discard information representing your numbers. I fyou had enough 
bits, ou couldreverse any FP calculation to get the original number, just
like how, with enough bit, you could represent an arbitarily large integer.BUT!! floating point numbers has poor accuracy. If ints are like bricks.
hen floats maight be thought of as silly putty. 
You have enough contrl to modl them into complex curved shapes, BUT!!
They leave something to be desired ehn it comes to forming a specified 
target shape. Imagine trying to make a perfect cube out of silly putty
you llnever get those corner as shapes as they should be. in fact, 
in manycasees thes is literally NO HOPE of a floating point answer's 
matching thecorect answer bit for bit..

We jsut have to prevent those little roundoff erros formstepping on
our toes. To that end andalos for general edification,
It nocetoknow how float actually work.



				Accuracy(roundoff)		Precision (divided by)
  integer    	GOOD					BAD
  float			BAD             		GOOD
  painter       GOOD                    GOOD

 \A only ever matchs at the start of string likewise only ever matches 
 at the end of the string. These two tokens never match at line breaks.
 This is true in all regex flavors discussed in this tutorial,
 even whenyou trun on "multiline mode". In EditPad Pro and PowerGREP,
 where the caret and dollar always match at the start and end 
 of line, \A and \Z only match at the start and the end of the entire file.



 LITERAL CHARACTERS
 The most basic regular expression consits of a single literal character,
 e.g. a. it will match the first occurrence of that character in the string
 if the string isJack is a boy. it will match the a after the J.
 The fact that this a is in the middle of the word does notmatter to thre
 regex engine. if it matters to you, you willneed to tell that to the 
 regex engine by using word boundaries. weee will get to that later.

 This regex can match the second a too. it will only do so when you tell 
 the regex engine to start searching through the string after the first 
 match. in a text editor, you can do so by using its find next or search 
 forward function. in a programming lanuage, there is usually a separate
 function taht you can call to continue searching through the string after
 the previous match.

 smilarly, the regex cat will match cat in About cats and dogs. this regul
 ar expression consists of a series of three literal characters.
 This is like saying to the regex engine. find a c,
 immediately followed by an a, immediately followed by a t.

 Note that regex engines are case sensitive by default.
 cat does not match Cat, unless you tell regex engine to ignore differences
 in case.

 Thus far, Ihave explained literal charactrers and character classes.
 In both cases, putting one in a regex will cause the regex engine
 to try to match a single character.

 Anchors are a different breed. They do not match any character at all.
 instead, they match a position before, after or between caharacters.
 They can be used to "anchor" the regex match at a certain positoon.

 The caret ^ matches the position before the first character in the string
 Applying ^a to abc matchs a. ^b will not match abc at all

 The EMF validation framework provides a means to evaluate and ensure
 the well-formedness of EMF models. Validation comes in two forms

  + batch 
  + live

 While batch validation allows a clients to explicitly evalutate
 a group of EObjects and their contents.

 LIVE validattion can be used by client to listen on change
 notifications to EObjects to immediately verify that the changes 
 does not violate the well-formedness of the model.

 Client contexts can be specified to ensure that certain constraints 
 do not get executed outside of certain context.
 A context is defined by the client to set up their own boundaries 
 from other clients

 This tutorial assumes that the reader has a knowledge of EMF.
 and the eclispse PDE development environment.
 It's essential that thereader understands the basic reflective
 mechanisms of EMF as well as its adapter/notifier system for
 broadcasting event.

 Constructing a Batch Model Constraint
  A model constraint is writtenas a subclass of the AbstractModel
  Constraint that overrides the validate() method


  AbstractModelConstraint
   + validate():IStatus <------------------------- IValidationContext
                                                      + getTarget()
													  + getEventType()

 The target EObject is retrieved form the IValidationContext by 
 calling the getTarget() method. 
 In order to rule out live validation cases,
 we check to ensure that the getEventTypee()  is EMFEventTyep.NULL.
 If our constaint provider extensionis writeen correctly,
 We shouldnever be called to perform a live validation.

 The constraint checks each type of object to ensure that its identifier
 is not nullor empty. In the case of a failure, it returns a failure
 status and place the name of the EObject's Eclass to be fromatted
 as part of the failure message.

 Creating a Client Context
  Client contexts are used by application writers to define the context
  in which theri validation will occur.
  This prevents constraints that were provided by a third-party for
  a third-party application formbeing executed in the wrong context.

  In our case, we don't wnat our constraint to be executed in any other
  context other than our own sowe will create our own client context
  and bind our constraint category to our context.


  org.eclipse.emf.validation.constraintBinding
   < clientContext id ="XXX"
    < selector class =XXXSelector
	< binding
	    context = "XXX"

 This extension registers the client context that is NOT a DEFAULT context.
 Default contexts will accumulate constraints and categories that have
 not been bound to any context. We provdie a unique identifier and
 a selctor class for this context. The selector has hte purpose of
 discovering whether an context. 
 A context binding is set up to link our category wiht our client
 context.
 The selector is a simple static latch we will latch wheneve we
 call the validationservice inthe next section.

 Using a client selector is not the only approach that can be used 
 to categorize an EObject as part of a client context.
 An alternative would be to use an XML enablement expression in an 
 enablementnode of the XML to reflectively produce a true /false value
 when evaluated against a Java Object.

 Diagnostic
  Information about the outcome of some activity.
 BasicDiagnostic
  A basic implementaion of a diagnostic that that aso acts as a chain.

 DiagnosticChain
  An accumulator of diagnostics.

The code invoking the validation can add to the map an instance of the 
EValidator.SubstitutionLabelProvider interface to be queried for the 
label object.


This design allows you to create a wrapper for the label provdider
you are useing for the UI, ensuring that a given instance will be 
consistently labelded across your application.

If there is no such object in the map, the method returns a unique 
identifier for the object, as defined by EcoreUtil.getIdentification().

The last comment to be made about the default implementation of the
xxx() method is related to this line.

The diagnostics object implemtns the DiagnosticChain interface and
can be used to group all teh diagnostics produced by the validation
of different constraints and invariants.

As we will see in the next section, the data available in a chain
of diagnostics provides very rich feedback to the user if properly
presented.

/*---------------------------*/

Again it's necessary to set the condition in the first if clause
and to ensure that the instantiated BasicDiagnostic has the right
information. F

or the preceding example,we could check if the item
is in a purchase order and if the order and ship date are correct
as follows;

We might alos need to customize the diagnostic that gets produced.
All of the previous comments about initializing he diagnostic and
computing the object's label are also applicable here.


/*-------------------*/
 YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM! in your application by validating your 
 objects at important moments or at the user'S discretion.

 A)

  Client ------hasUSState()----> MOdel
         -----.INSTANCE-------->Validator
		 -validate-Instance

		 Cons: This has to be manually updated to reflect any future 
		       changes to the model. New constraints and invariants or e
			   ven structural changes to the model easily make this 
			   method useless.

 B) 

  Client ------.INSTANCE----->Validator
         -validateUSADDRESS()
		 -validateItem()


		 Design; Whenever the package's validator class is generated.
		         it will include a validate method for each class  
				 defined in the package. Here, we are invoking these
				 methods, which are guaranteed to call out to all the
				 constraints and invariants defined on the corresponding
				 classes. Here you are involding these methods,
				 which are guaranteed to call out to all the constraints
				 and invarinats defined on the corresponding classes.

				 Be in Framework.

		Cons:  It does not strengthen the algorithm to support other
		       changes to the model. because the models have a tendency
			   to evolve, we could try another more generic implimentation

 C)
  Client   ------getEPackage()-->MOdel
           ------.INSTANCE-----> EValidator.Registory
		   -getEValidator-
		   --validate()-> EValidator

        
         Design: This implementation exposes the EValidator interface,
		         which we have not mentioned until now.
				 A Evalidator is an object responsible for performing 
				 validation. as you might guess, PPOValidator, like any 
				 other generated package's validator class implments 
				 this interface.

				 When geterated package is being initialized.
				 it registers its default validator in EValidator.Registry
				 which then can be queried by any code that needs to 
				 validate an object.

	    Cons:  It does not handle the scenario in which an object contains
			   objects from different package.

 D)
        To be as general as possible, we would have to ensure that
		we are using the appropriate validator for each object in
		the containment tree. that is, the validator registered for
		the packeage in which the OBJECT'S Class is defined.


		As you can see, there are lots of details to be considered
		when writing a method to validate constraints and invariants. 
		With this class, we can easily write the final version of the
		validateObject() method we've been evolving in this section!!!


 Client   ---.INSTANCE ----> Diagnostician
          -validate(eObject)


		  The Diagnostician class provides several methods 
		  to start a validation. of which we've selected the simplest.
		  
		  The others allows you to specify, for example, the context
		  and diagnostic chain to use in the validation. 

		  Diagnostician also provides methods to verify 
		  if a givenvalue violates any constraint defined for a data type.
		  
		  These methods can be really handy in some several adapters
		  listening to changes in your model.
          You can use one of these methods to validate a value before
		  actually modifying an attribute of a class.



    Cons ;  One interesting side effect of using a Diagnostican
	        is that you can easily compute the result of the
			evaluation based on a diagnostic, instead of simply
			forwarding a boolean return value.


/*--------------------------*/
  Generated editors already provide a Validate action, which uses a 
  diagnostician to perform full validation of the object selected
  in the editor.

  To use this UI to validate the constraints and invariant,
  you neeed to generate editor and edit plugins for PrimerPO model

  The appinfo child of the annotation element is designed to pass

2012/01/19 
To include a backslash as a character without any special meaning inside 
a character class, you have to escape it with another backslash.
[\\x] matches a backslash or an x.

 
 \,^,- can be included by escaping them with a backslash
                       by placing them in a position where do not take on
					   their special meaning.
 
 I recommend the latter method, since it improves readability.
 To include a caret, place it anywhere exept rigth after the opening bran
 ket. [x^] matches an x or a caret. YOu can put the closing branket right
 after the opening brancktor the negating caret matches a closing branket
 or an x. []x] but
 [^]x] matches any character that is not a closing branket or an x.

 Shorthand Character Classes 
 Since certain character classes are used often,
 a series of shorthand character classes are available.

  \d is short for [0-9]
  \w stands for "word character", usually [A-Za-0-9_]
  \s stands ofr "whitespace character",[ \t\r\n] ( space, tab, line break)

  Negative Shorthand Character Classes
  The above three shorthands also have negative versions.

   \D is the same as [^\d].
   \W is short for [^\w].
   \S is the equivalent of [^\s].

   Be carefule when using the negated shorthands inside square brankets.
   [\D\S] is NOT the same as [^\d\s].

   The latter will match any character that is not a digit or whitespace
   So it will match x, but not 8. The former, however, will match any 
   character that is either not a digit, or is not whitespace.
   So former will match any character, digit, whitespace or otherwise.

Repeating Character Classes
If you repeat a character class by using the ? * + operators,
You will repeat the entire character class, and not just the
character that it matched. The regex [0-9+] can match 834 as wellas 333

If you want to repeat he matched character, rather than the class,
you will need to use backreferences ([0-9])\1+ will match 333 not 322.

Reqular Expression Basic Syntax 
Any Character except [\^$.|?*+()   ----> match a single instance of 
                                         themselves

\ followedby any of special characters to suppress their special meaning


. (dot)  matches any single character except line break characters
         \r and \n.
^(caret) Matches at the start of the string the regex pattern is applied
         to.  Matches a positoin rather than a character. 
           ^. match a in abc
[^        Negates the character class, causing itto match a single 
          character notlisted in the character class.
		     [^a-d] matchs x (any character except a, b, c or d)


$ (dollar) Matches at the end of the string the regex pattern is appliedto.
 
?     Make the preceding item optional.   abc? matchs ab or abc
*     Repeats the previous item zero or more times.
       so:, ".*" matchs xx  test "xx" test "ss" test
+     Repeats the previous item once or more.
       so, ".+" matchs "xx" test "ss" in test "xx" test "ss" test

Positive and Negative Lookahead
Negative look-ahead is indispensable if you want to match something
not followed by something else.
When explaining character class, I already explained why you cannot
 use a negated character class to match a "q" not followed by a "u".
 Negative lookahead provides the solution. q(?!u).The negative lookahead 
 construct is the PAIR of round brackets, with the opening brancket
 follwed by a question mark and an exclamationpint. inside the look
 ahea, we have teh trivial regex u.

 Positive lookahead work just the same q(?=u)


 (?=[^@])

Metacharacters Inside Character Classes
  Note that the only special characters or metacharacters inside a charac
  ter class are 
     the closing brancket(]), 
	 the baskslash(\),
	 the caret(^),
	 the hyphen(-).

  The usual metacharacters are normal characters inside a charactrer class.
  and not need to be escaped by a backslash.

 
  To search for a star or plus, use[+*].
  YOur regex will work fine if you escape the regular metacharacter inside
  a character class, but doing so significantly reduces readability.



2012/01/19 
 Negated Character Classes
  Typing a caret after the opening square brancket will nagate the caharac
  ter class. The result is taht the character class will match any charac
  ter that is NOT in the character class. Unlike the dot. negated character
  also match (invisible) line break charecter.
  It is important to remember that a negated character class STil must
  match a character . q[^u] does not mean. "a q not followed by a u".
  It means "a q followed by a character that is not a u."
  it will not match the q in the string Iraq.
  it will match the q and the space after the  q in Iraq is a country.
  Indeed: the space will be part of the overall match. because it is the 
  character taht is not a u" that is matched by the negated character class
  in the above regexp. if you want the regex to match the q, and ONLY q,
  in both strings, you need to use negative lookahead q(?\u).


 Negated Shorthand Character Classes
 The above three shorthands also have negatd versions.
 [\D] is the same as [^\d].
 
 
 Regular expresion ( regexp ) 
  => 
   The W3C XML Schema standard defines its own regular expression flavor.
   You can use it in the pattern facet of simple type definitions in your
   XML schemas.

   e.g. the following defines the simple type SSN using a regular 
        expression to require the element to contain a valid US Social 
		Seculrity Number.

		<xsd:simple...

 The XML Schema flavor is quite limited infeatures.
 Since it's only used to validate whether an entire element matches a
 pattern or not. The limitations allow schema validators to be 
 implemented with efficient text-directed engines.

 Particularly noteworthy is the complete absence of anchors like the
 caret and dollar, word boundaries adn lookaround. XML schema always
 implicitly anchors the entire regular expression. 
 The regexp must match the whole element for the element to be considered
 valid. If you have the pattern regexp, the XML schema validator will
 apply it in the sama way as say Perl, Java or .NET Would do with the 
 pattern ^regexp$. 

 If you want to accept all elements with regex SOMEWHERE in the middle
 of their contents, you will need to use the regular expression 
 .*regex.* The to .* expand the match to cover the whole element,
 assuming it does not contain line brakes. If you want allow line brakes,
 you can use something like [\s\S].*regexp.*[\s\S].

 Combining  a shorthand character class

 Character Classes or Character Sets	
 With Character class, also character set, you can tell the regexp engine
 to match only one out of several characters.
 Simpley place the character you want to match between square brankets.
 If you want to match an a or e , use [ae].
 You could use this in gr[ea]y to match graay or graey or any such thing.
 The order of the characters inside a character class does not matter.
 The result is identical.

 You can use a hyphen inside a character class  to specify the range of
 characters. [0-9] matchs a SINGLE digit between 0 and 9.
 [0-9a-fA-F] matches a single hexadesimal digit, case insensitively.
 You can combine renges and single characters. 

 THE ORDER OF THE CHARCTERS IN THE CLASS AND THE RANGES DOES NOT MATTER.

 git-clone Clone a repository into a new directory.

 SYNOPSIS
    git clone <repository> <directory>

	Clones a repository into a newly Created directory,
	Creates remote-tracking branchs fro each branch in the cloned
	repository ( visible using git branch -r ), and creates and 
	CREATES and checks out an initial branch that is forked from
	the cloned repository's currently active branch.

	After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update
	all the remote-trackign branches,
	and a git pull without arguments will in addition merge the remote
	master branchinto the current master branch, if any.

    This default configuration is achived by creating references
	to the remote branch heads under refs/remotes/origin and by
	Initializing remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch 
	configuration variables.

	refs/remote/origin

 <refspec> : The format of a <refspace> parameter is an optional plus
             ..

			 (+)<src>:<dst>

			 the remote ref that matches <src> is fetched,
			 and
			 if<dst> is not empty string
			 the local ref that matches it is fast-forwarding using <src>.

			 If the optional plus + is used, 
			 the local ref is updated even if it does not result in a
			 fast-forward update

2012/01/15 
 There is one special case not mentioned above.
 which is treated differently.
 Normally, a merge results in a merge commit with two parents,
 one for each of the two lines of development that were merged.
 However, ifthe current branch has not diverged from the other
 SO every commit present in the current branch is already contained
 in the other then git just performes a "fast-forward", the 
 head of current branch IS MOVED FORWARD to the point at the head
 of the merged-in branch, WIHTOUT ANY NEW COMMIT BEING CREATED.

 To motivate goal must have:
   1. Clarity
   2. Challenge
   3. Commitment
   4. Feedback
   5. Task complexitly

2012/01/14 
 Goal setting is a powerful way of motivating people,
 and of motivating yourself. The value of goal setting is so well 
 recognized that entire management system have goal setting basics
 incorporatedwithin them.
 In fact, goal setting theory is generallly accepted as among the
 most valid and useful motivation theories inindustrial 
 and organizational psychology, human resource manageiment,
 and organizational behavior.
 Many of use have learned form bosses, seminars, and business articles
 to set SMART goals. It seems natural to assume that by setting a goal
  that is specific, measurable,attainable, relevant, and time-bound,
  we will be well on our way to accomplishing it.
?
  But is this really the best way of setting goals?
  To answer this, we look to Dr Edwin LOcke's pioneering research on
  goal setting and motivation in the late 1960s.
   In his 1968 article Toward a Theory of Task Motivation and Incentives
  He stated that employees were motivated by clear goals and
  appropriate feedback. Locke went on to say that working toward a goal
   provided a major source of motivation to actually reach the goal 
   which,  in turn,, improved performancre.

   This informationdoes not seem revolutionary to us some 40 years later.
    This shows the impact his theory hashad on professional and personal
	 performance.

  In this article, we look at what locke had to say about goal setting,
   and how we can apply his theory to our own performance goals.

    clear goals          ------> motivation --------> performance
	appropriate feedback ------>

   Me : is an object pronoun, which means that is refrs ot the 
        person that the action of a verb is being done
        or to which a preposition refers
		   + They want me to study more.
		   + Tell me a story
		   + between you and me, he's right.
		   + Carol wants to meet with John and me tmorrow.
		   + The book was written entirely by me.

   Myself : is a reflexive or stressed pronoun, which means that,
            generally speaking, it should be used in conjunction 
			with the subject pronoun I, not instead of the object 
			pronoun me.

 Just remember that myself can be reflexiveor emphatic.
 Otherwise, you probably want to see me.

 remind vs remember

   One of the most frequently asked quextions about songwriting is:
   "What's the difference between a songlyric and a poem?" 
   The answer to this question can determine the ultimate success
   of aspiring song lyricists.
u
   similar yet distinct art forms
  
   poets in the modern world don't enjoy the evated social status
   they did a century or two ago.
   wordworth, byron, keats and shelley were the rock stars of their time.
   their poetic skills earned them adulation, celebrity and even a touch of
   wealth.
   these days, poems and poetry are sadly relagated to sparsely 
   attended coffeehouse readings or the abscure pages of tiny litery 
   managazine.

   poetry : shi as one of the genres
   poem   : shi itself.

   on the other side of the proverbial coin, there are wonderful opportunite
   es available indoday's music industry for talented poets who successfully
   adapt their writing style to song lyric writing.

   songs are the popular lyrical medium of our time.
   that's where the status is.
   that's where the money is.


   Which leads to this question : Can poets successfully turn their 
   talents to writing song lyrics?
   Answer : For talented poets willing to adapt their writing styles 
   to the craft fo lyric writing, the answer is definitely yes.

    A poem:
	      + designed to be read on the page
          + can be dense in idea and structurally complex.
		  + designed to connect with a reader.
		  + stands alone without music
 	A lyric:
	      + designed to be song by human and heard with music
		  + needs to communicate with immediacy, clarity and focused impact
          + designed to connect with a listener
		  + must work well with the rhythm and structure of music.

Best Practice:
  + Leverage the common error message logging facility.

 * 4 components of the format for common error messages
  1) message id		provides a quick means to distinguish one message
  2) message text	briefly describes the problem
  3) explanation	includes the reason that the message was generated
  4) action			suggets ways to resolve the problem.

 * For error message shown in UI, do NOT show the ID,
   But make it accessible.

    UI error messages are intended for end users, NOT DEVELOPERS.
	Therefore we should not intimidate end users with a 
	cryptic message ID

  * Log each ERROR message shown in the UI to a log file also.
  * Show the message ID as the first item and make it a hyperlink to 
    addtional information.
  * For error messages shown in the problems view,
    exploit the QuickFixfeature to offer sholution to users.
	=> Since limited space is available in the problems view,
	   for errors or warnings shown in that view, 
	   we should exploit the QuickFix feature to offer solutions 
	   to users where possble.

 Tips and Trick
   Forcus work effort on the errors frequently encounteredin typical user
    scenarios.
   Obtain a list of top PMRs form our support team, and address those 
   errors as a first priority.
Use the common structure of error messages to help users diagnose and
recover from errors. This will increase user's self-sufficiency and 
reduce suppooret costs for Eclipse-based products.

Problem Description:
 Across Eclipse base products, error messages are displayed inconsistently.
 This inconsistency makes i t difficult for users to understand error
 conditions, and to diagnose and recover from problems.

   1. Use the Eclipse look and feel if extending or plugging into Eclipse.
   2. Use common SWT controls to get What SWT offer for cross-platform
      adapteability and accessibility
   3. Be familiar with APIs for the UIs you are building
   4. Use icons and graphics consistent with the Eclipse style, 
       decorations, states, and quality
   5. Understand the conventions of the OSs you are developing for.
   6. Use understandable message to help the people recover from error 
      conditions.
   7. Don't initiate dialogs or wizard in a error state.
   8. Use quick fix and quick assist mechanisms
   9. Reserve time for "polish"

New Status Dialog:
 Main Concepts:
  +Message 	This is the most important piece of info.
  +Details  Sometime there is not enough place to display all necessary info
  +Support  It is possible to place some contact form on the dialog.
Requirements;
 + shows list of the problems
 + shows details of the problems
 + shows view which helps user to handle or report the problems
 ]]]]]]

Eclipse
 Context 
  +The error manager framework must keep track of the context and
   if the error handler decides toshow the error to the user.
   the ErrorManagerFramework should use the appropriate UserInterface.
   
   ModalDialog Cont]ext
   JobError Context
   Wizard Context
   Error Log Contxt
  ERROR 		:SHOW
  WARNING DO 	:DO NOT SHOW
  INFORMATION	:DO NOT SHOW

 HOW TO SHOW IT
     MODAL DIALOG : SHOULD NOT USE
	 * the user can glance in the result in the botton right corner,
	   click on it to see the list of errors and click onan error to
	   see a detail.
     * The view shows the different errors from the log.
	   The user can click on an error in the list to see more details.


 Error Messages : UserInterface
  There are three types of user interfaces that will present a message,
  an error or a warning to a user. The three categories are
   + Message that requires user's action NOW.
   + Message that requires user's action that can be done LATER
   + List of messages.

   ]]
 Status manager is the entry point for all statuses to be reported
 in the user interface. Handlers are not intended to be used directly.
 See the error
  Its very important to distinguish between expected and unexpected error.
  Chencked	<Exception>	
  								+Expected by a DEVELOPER  (NW is NOT avail.)
								+UnExpected  SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.
  Unchecked	<RuntimeException>
  								+Expected by all the developer 
								+UnExpected  SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. (NPE)

 POLICY: It is the responsibility of the fearure provider,
                                     the product provider,
									 company to decide what the action will 
									 do.

 Eclipse could still provide a 'show log' button that policy provider can
  extend

 Generally expected errors should come with idea HOW TO SLOVE THE PROBLEM
 Platform UI Error Handling
 ISSUE TO SOLVE:
 This is the main issue to solve for the 4 customers.
 + When an error occurs in the tooling,
   Eclipse needs to provide a way for the users to:
     + see what the error is
	 + understand what it means to the them
	 + how can they act on the error

 The behavior for each is based on policies
  + The feature who threw the error should have a chance
     to handle the error and help the customer.
  + The feature should have an idea about what the error
    handler it to do.
	  i.e. when there is an error opening a view should
	       we shouw the error view or not.
		   also do we prompt when the workbench layout
		   be reset?
  + The product that is installed can override all feature's 
    behavior it ships and manage or delegate to them as appropriate.
 There is a simple way to contribute a support area in the JFace.ErrorDialog
 Its the ErrorSupportProvider which can be set in the JFace policy.
 Because the default workbench handler uses a subclass of the ErrorDialog
 for its dialog.
 The default status handler
 The platform supplies its own status handler implementaion
 org.eclipse.ui.statushandlres.WorkbenchErrorHandler.
 It respects all acceptable sytle. and a dialog based on the JFace
 org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.ErrorDialog.
 In order to log extra informationwith the use of the default logging 
 mechanism, it is necessary to perform some additional steps.
 The status manager provides you with an API that allows you to hook
 into the mechanism.

 Status handling is a facility that allows to introduce a custom way of 
 showing problems in the Eclipse based applications to USERs.
 The facility can be configured at both the application and the product
 level. The handlers are respnsible for presenting problems by logging or
 showing appropriate feedback to the user.
 All status hanlders extend AbstractStatusHandler which requires each 
 handler to implement handle(StatusAdapter status, int style).
 This method handles statuses based on a handling style.]
 The STYLE indicates HOW STSTUS handler should handle a status.
   /*--------------*/
   The runtime exception classes are exempted from compile-time
   checking, since the compiler cannot establish that run-time exceptions
   cannot occur.
   In the classes that you design you should subclass Exception and throw
   instances of it to signal any exceptional scenarios.
   Doing so you will be explicitly signaling the CLIENTS OF YOUR CLASS
   that usage of your class maight throw exception and they have to 
   take step to handle those exceptional scenarios.
   In java, there are two types of exceptions :
     + checked ceptions   	: Must be handled by the code.
	 + un-checked exceptions	: Does Not Need to be handled.

   Any exception that derives from Exception is a CHECKED exception.
   RuntimeException is UN-CHECKED.
   Someone please explain the difference between java.lang.RuntimeExcep
   tion and java.lang.Exception How do I decide which one to extend 
   if I create my own exception??
   If you check for null before calling any method, NPE would never occur.

								Catch
  java.lang.Exception			Need	
  java.lang.RuntimeException	NoNeed ]]]Can be prevented programmatically
  java.lang.Throwable
  java.lang.Error

 Create Markers

  IResource resource = type.getUnderlyingResource();
  IMarker marker = resource.createMarker(IMarker.TASK);

  Eclipse represents Resourceslike Projects, Files, Folders, Packages
  as IResource. Marker represent additional informations for resource.
   e.g. an error marker. Every marker can have attribute( key/value pair)
   Markers can be displayed in the standard view, e.g. the Task,Bookmark
   or the problems view. To be displayed in thse views you have to use
   prefedined attribute. The following will demonstrate how to create
   marker for a selected resource.

 In some java source the convention of declaring an argument final has 
 started to appear. This declares that the variable passed in CANNOT
 BE REASSIGNED, and the compiler WILL COMPLAIN. Changing the above example
 to say void foo(final String bar) causes my javac to complain with
  : variable bar might already has been assigned to bar = "foo".	

  This construction and some of it's similarity and differences from 
  C++ const declaration are clear.

  Unlike in C++ where assigning to a reference parameter will have effects
  outside the current scope to the variable that was aliased by the parame
  ter. BUT in JAVA Final is mandated if you want to have instance of iner
  classes declared within the method scope reference the formal parameter
  of the method. Exmanple

  *final* is misleading because ti means different things for methods
   and different things  for variables and methods.
   For method it MEANS CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN.
   For variable it means "IT CAN ONLY BE INITIALIZED BUT NOT ASSIGNED TO".
    
   Espacially since a variable declared +final+ is NOT generally expected
   to have the behaviour of a constant, final looks quite funny cause it
   essentially noting. the caller should NOT assume (inspite the final key
   work) that the object passed as the variable , will NOT be Modified 
   Because it IS DECLARED FINAL. final in this context has NO SIGNIFICANT 
   semantic other than allowing for the inner class construction......

   The final keyword has slightly differenct meanings
   depending on the context. but in general it says:
   "This cannot be changed." you maight want to prevent
    changes for two reason
	 1)  design
	 2)  efficiency
    
	because these two reasons are quite different.
	it possible to misuse the final keyword.

	The following sections discuss the three places
	where final can be used: 
	 + for data
	 + for methods
	 + for a class


	Final Data :
    Many proramming languages have a way to tell the 
	compiler that a piece of data is "constant".
	constant is useful for two reasons
	 1) It can be a compile-time constant that won't 
	    ever change.
	 2) It can be a value initialized at run-time 
	    that you dont want changed

		Static final         : piece of storage cannot changed
		final with object    : makesthe handle a constant
		final with primitive : makes the value a constant

		The handle must be initialized to an object 
		at the point of declaration and the handle 
		can never be changed to point to another object.
		How ever the object can be modefied.
		Java DOES NOT PROVIDE A WAY TO MAKE ANY ARBITRARY
		OBJECT a constant.

		final int i1=9;           : compile time constants
		static final int i2 = 22; : compile time constants
		 are all named with all CA+ITALS by convention.

		final int i4 = (int) (Math.random()*23);  : run-time constants
		static final int i5 = (int) (Math.random()*33); : run-time constants
	   
	    Note that the values of i4 for fd1 and fd2 are unique.
        BUT the value ofr i5 is not changed by creating the 
		second FinalData object. That's because it's static
		and is initialized once upon LOADING and not each tiem
		anew object is created.

		The variables v1 through v4 demonstrate the meaning of 
		a final handle As you can see in main(), just because v2
		is final doesn't mean that YOU CAN NOT CHNAGNE ITS VALUE.
		HOWEVER YOU CAN NOT RE-BUILD v2 to a new Object.

		Value v1 = new Value();
		final Value v2 = new Value();
		static final value v3 = new Value();	

		precisely because it's final 
		That's what final means for a hondle.
		YOu can also see the same meaning holds true
		for an array, which is just another kind of handle
		Making handles final seems less useful than making primitives final.


		Blank Final:
		Java 1.1 allows the creation of blank finals,
		which are fields that are declared as final but are NOT given
		an initialization value. In all caces, the blank final must
		be initialized before it is used, and the compiler ensures this.
		However, blank finals provide much more flexibity in the use of the
		final keyword since, for example, a final field inside a class
		can now be different for each object and yet it retains its 
		immutable quality. 

		you are forced to perform assignements to finals either with
		and expression at the point of definition of the field OR
		in every CONSTRUCZTOR. This way it's guaranteed that the final
		field is always initializaed before use.

		Final Arguments:
		Java 1.1 allows you to make arguments FINAL by declaring 
		them as such in the argument list. This means that inside
		the method you can NOT CHANGE WHAT the argument handle point to.

		+ you can only read from a final primitive.
		+ you can only call method of a final handle.


		Note That you can still assign a null handle to an arguemnt
		that's final without the compiler catching it.
		just like you can with a non-final argument.

 There are three steps that msut be followed to use 
 these classes about Reflection.

   Step1. Obtain a java.lang.Class object!
          that you want to manipulate.
		  java.lang.CLass is used to represent classes and interfaces
		  in a running Java program.
		     One way of obtaining a Class object is to say:

			     Class c  = Class.forName("java.lang.String");
				 Class c  = int.class // to get the Class object for String
				 Class c  = Integer.TYPE

   Step2. Call the method on it!
   Step3. Use the reflection API to manipulate the information.

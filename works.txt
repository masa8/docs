 There are three steps that msut be followed to use 
 these classes about Reflection.

   Step1. Obtain a java.lang.Class object!
          that you want to manipulate.
		  java.lang.CLass is used to represent classes and interfaces
		  in a running Java program.
		     One way of obtaining a Class object is to say:

			     Class c  = Class.forName("java.lang.String");
				 Class c  = int.class // to get the Class object for String
				 Class c  = Integer.TYPE

   Step2. Call the method on it!
   Step3. Use the reflection API to manipulate the information.
